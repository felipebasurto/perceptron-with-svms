# perceptron-with-svms

The project is aimed at identifying number plates in the city of Burgos. It was developed as part of a university project in 2020 and is now being uploaded to GitHub.  The project utilizes deep learning techniques to detect and recognize number plates. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems.  In this project, we use Perceptrons, which are the simplest type of artificial neural network. They consist of a single layer of output nodes and can be used for binary classification problems.  We also use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) which are a type of machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression analysis.
