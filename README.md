# perceptron-with-svms

The project is aimed at identifying number plates in the city of Burgos.\
It was developed as part of a university project in 2020 and is now being uploaded to GitHub.\
The project utilizes deep learning techniques to detect and recognize number plates. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems.\

In this project, we use two different techniques for solving binary classification problems: Perceptrons and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

## Perceptrons
Perceptrons are the simplest type of artificial neural network, consisting of a single layer of output nodes. They are well-suited for binary classification problems, where the goal is to distinguish between two classes based on a set of features. 

The weights of the connections between the input and output nodes determine the decision boundary of the network, and can be learned through an optimization process, such as gradient descent. The output node applies a activation function, such as the step function, to determine the final output of the network.

## Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
SVMs are a type of machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression analysis. Unlike Perceptrons, SVMs can be applied to non-linearly separable data and use the concept of support vectors to define the optimal decision boundary. 

The decision boundary is defined by the maximum margin, which is the distance between the boundary and the closest data points. SVMs can handle linear and non-linear classification through the use of kernel trick, which maps the input data into a higher dimensional space where the classes are linearly separable.

In conclusion, Perceptrons and SVMs offer different approaches for solving binary classification problems, and provide trade-offs between simplicity and flexibility in the optimization process.
